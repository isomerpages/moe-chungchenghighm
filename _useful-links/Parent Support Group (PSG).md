Chung Cheng High School (Main) PSG is proud to have ‘With Passion, we Serve and Grow!’ as our motto. Since its inauguration in 2001, membership has grown and remained strong with at least 300 members. As parents, we recognise the importance of working hand in hand with the school for the good of our children.

Throughout the year, PSG members contribute by supporting the various activities organised by the school. As members volunteer for the various activities, they also have opportunities to interact with the network of parent volunteers, with the students, with the school staff and also with the community at large.
