Background
----------

Recognising the importance of a holistic family learning model and the potentials of promoting affirmative family values in the school environment, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) initiates FamilyMatters@Schools as a movement to give a greater push to family life education and promotion efforts within the family and in school.

Community Partnership
---------------------

*   Equip parents with the skills and knowledge to enrich and strengthen their family life; and foster better parent-child understanding and relationship;
*   Equip students with life skills; skills to build healthy relationships with their peers and family; and/or imbue positive values and attitudes towards family, relationships and life in general.

CCHMS FamilyMatters@School Programme includes activities organised by the Fathers@CCHMS and the Family Life Education (FLE) workshops. The FLE workshops for parents are conducted in both English and Mandarin by external vendors on a regular basis. Details of the workshops can be found in the sub-section “Information on FLE Workshops” below.

The Family Life Education workshops have been successful in enhancing the quality of family life for parents, students, teachers and other school staff.
