Our Cross Country team seeks to develop our students’ fitness and mental strength, based on core values of the spirit of excellence, sportsmanship, and teamwork. Our team conducts training at various venues where we enjoy the beautiful green outdoors of Singapore, as our students give their best to take on the challenge of every run.  

_**Note: Secondary 1 CCA recruitment for Cross Country will cease from 2020 onwards.**_
