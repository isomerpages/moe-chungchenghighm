Our Guzheng Ensemble promotes the love and appreciation for Guzheng’s Chinese classical pieces. From learning essential skills in score reading and instrument tuning to improving sound quality to the interpretation of the mood in different classical pieces, students develop confidence through rigorous training programmes.  

_**Note: Secondary 1 CCA recruitment for Guzheng will cease from 2020 onwards.**_
