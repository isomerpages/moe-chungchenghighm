Dear Class of 2021,

We would like to inform you that your School Graduation Certificate (SGC) is ready for collection at the School General Office from **25 April 2022 (Mon)**. Please bring along your **identification card** for the collection.

The collection of School Yearbook 2021 will be announced at a later date.

In view of the current COVID-19 situation, all visitors coming into school must enter via the Main Gate and report to school’s Security Post. Please adhere to the following days and timeslots for the collection:

<p style="color:blue"><strong>Days of the week:</strong> Every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday</p>

<p style="color:blue"><strong>Time:</strong> 2pm to 4.30pm</p> 


We encourage you to collect your SGC at the earliest possible time, based on the above collection schedule. Alumni visitors are should not loiter in the school casually as that may disrupt ongoing school activities. Alumni who need to look for any teacher should request the General Office to contact the teacher and arrange for a meeting with the teacher in school

Our Chung Cheng students have always been looking up to their seniors as role models, and therefore all alumni coming back to school are only allowed to enter the school campus if they are able to meet the below decorum expectations

1\. Slippers and other inappropriate footwear are not allowed  
2\. Earrings for boys and all inappropriate headwear (e.g. caps with offensive wording) are not allowed  
3\. Shirts with offensive and disrespectful wordings are not allowed.

We will like to thank all alumni in advance for showing respect to the school when visiting your alma mater.

“今日我以中正为荣，他日中正以我为荣！”

For enquiries, please contact the General Office at 6344 1393 during office hours.

Thank you.
