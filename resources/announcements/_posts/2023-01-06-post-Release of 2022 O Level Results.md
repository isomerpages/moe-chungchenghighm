Dear 2022 Graduates,

The school will be releasing your O-Level results on **12 January 2023, 2pm** in school. 

Please do not come to school earlier than 1.30pm. Parents are welcomed to wait at the back of the School Hall or in the Canteen that day.

You will need to note the following as you return to school to collect your results:
*	Please enter through the Front Gate. Entry via the other gates is not allowed to avoid congestion.
*	You will be receiving your results at the School Hall.
*	Please be attired in school uniform.
*	Please bring along your NRIC or EZ Link Card for identification purposes.

School candidates who are unwell or are required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result should not return to school to collect their results. Instead, you may view your results online via SEAB results release system at www.seab.gov.sg from 2.45pm on 12 January 2023. School candidates who are eligible for Singpass can use their Singpass account to access SEABâ€™s Candidates Portal. The system will be accessible from 12 to 26 January 2023. Alternatively, you can appoint a proxy to receive your results. Please call the General Office at 63441393 if you need assistance.
