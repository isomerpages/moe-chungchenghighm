For students who would like to appeal for transfer to CCHM, you will need to submit an online appeal form. 

The link is as follows:
[https://go.gov.sg/cchm24-s1-appeal](https://go.gov.sg/cchm24-s1-appeal)

The deadline for the submission of appeals is on 27 December 2024, 12pm. The application is deemed to be unsuccessful if you do not hear from the school by 10 January 2025.

Thank you.
