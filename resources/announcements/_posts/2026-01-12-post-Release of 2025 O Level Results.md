Dear 2025 Graduates, 

The school will be releasing your O-Level results on 14 January 2026. You are to report to the Grand Auditorium by 1.30 pm. Please do not come to school earlier than 1.00pm. Your parents are welcome to wait at the back of the Grand Auditorium or in the Canteen that day.

Please note the following as you return to school to collect your results:

•	Please enter through the Front Gate. Entry via the other gates is not allowed to avoid congestion.<br>
•	You will be receiving your results in the Grand Auditorium.<br>
•	You are to be attired appropriately in school uniform, in the correct decorum. <br>
•	Please bring along your NRIC or EZ Link Card for identification purposes.

School candidates who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to collect their results. School candidates who are unable to collect their results in person can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf from the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school's verification when collecting the results. 

Please call the General Office at 63441393 if you need assistance.
