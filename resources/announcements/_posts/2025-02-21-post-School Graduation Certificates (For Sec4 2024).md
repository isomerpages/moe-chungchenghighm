Please collect your certificate from the school’s General Office, located on the Ground Floor of our Zhulin Building.

Details for collection are as follows:

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
		<td><b>Dates</b></td>
    <td>24 Feb 2025 – 1 Aug 2025</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
		<td><b>Day(s)</b></td>

</tbody></table>


Please bring a valid Student Card for identification, such as your <b>NRIC or Student EZ Link Card.</b>

Should you be unable to come down to school yourself, your next-of-kin family member can collect on your behalf by bringing along your <b>NRIC or EZ Link Card.</b>

The 2024 School Yearbook will be released later this year.

Thank you.
