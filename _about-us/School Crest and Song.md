The three sides of the triangle represent the collaboration between the school’s management, teachers and pupils. These three work hand in hand to bring the school to greater heights. The colour red represents the school motto – “With Passion We Learn, With Perseverance We Strive” and “With Integrity We Live, With Commitment We Progress”. It inspires pupils to be upright, caring and loyal citizens. White symbolises purity and also signifies the imparting of knowledge. It serves to highlight the dual importance our school places on encouraging our pupils to achieve excellence in both studies and character building.

曰吾中正 至大至刚

矗立星洲 巍巍昂昂

华夏声教 广披炎荒

欧印文明 他山之长

好学力行 知耻是倡

日新月异 不息自强

止於至善 万国同光

大哉中正 悠久无疆

Our School Song (Translation)
-----------------------------

Overlooking the eastern shore of Singapore,  
Gallantly stands the magnificent Chung Cheng of ours.  
Spreading far and wide our cultural heritage and traditions,  
Enriching it with the best of all great civilizations,  
By this we fulfil our mission.  
With enthusiasm and perseverance we strive  
To achieve moral virtues and excellence.  
With new knowledge and wisdom we seek  
To constantly reinforce our confidence.  
To be the best we can be,  
Our success and glory we share  
With people of all countries.  
To eternity we perpetuate  
The aspirations of our magnificent Chung Cheng,  
Far beyond all boundaries.
