<p style="text-align:center;">Student Council</p>

In the Student Council, we endeavour to develop Student Councillors with the Growth Mindset ready to challenge themselves and embrace failure, possessing both mental and emotional resilience to continually improve and lead.

We believe a Chung Cheng Student Councillor must have the passion, commitment and skills to build a kinder and more inclusive environment for their peers to learn and grow.

Through conceptualising and executing needs-based projects, we hope to address genuine concerns of our student population, as well as the community around us.
