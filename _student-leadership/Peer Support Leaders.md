**Peer Support Leaders**

Peer Support Leaders help to develop resilience and support amongst their peers in the social and moral domains. They help to ensure that learning takes place in a safe and caring environment, where there is mutual respect. Peer Support Leaders undergo a period of training to develop skills which enable them to spot signs of stress among their peers and offer practical help and emotional support to them.

We believe that Peer Support Leaders must be caring, respectful and trustworthy, displaying a strong sense of empathy and moral courage, so as to positively influence peers in the school community through their strong interpersonal skills. By planning and executing small-scale school events, we hope that our Peer Support Leaders promote overall student well-being and strengthen the positive network of peers in the school.
