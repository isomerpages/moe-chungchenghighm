**Class Leaders**

Class Leaders help by supporting their Form Teachers and peers in managing administrative duties pertaining to their classes. They develop a good rapport with their classmates and help to ensure that the classroom is conducive for learning. Through training programmes, Class Leaders develop skills which enable them to be more proactive in meeting the needs of the class.

We believe that Class Leaders must be responsible in the discharge of duties and be committed to leading the class during class-based projects and activities. By planning and executing class-based events and community involvement projects, we hope that our Class Leaders can promote a positive class culture which serves to strengthen class ties and serve the wider community.
