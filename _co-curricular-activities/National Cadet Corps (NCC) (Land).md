Our National Cadet Corps (NCC) (Land) unit prides itself on developing responsible and resilient students. We aim to groom our NCC cadets to become committed citizens and inspirational leaders through challenging military-related activities such as orienteering, weapon handling, and individual field crafts. They also have opportunities to participate in overseas adventure trips and engage in physical recreation like learning Taekwondo.
