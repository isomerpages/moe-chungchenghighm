Our Concert Band CCA has grown in size and strength over the years. With the combined effort of teachers, conductors, and student leaders, our CCA mission is to ignite the passion for music, to grow more musical talents and to develop outstanding characters. Our Band takes pride in its strong discipline culture. All students work relentlessly towards every performance, putting in the best effort evident in intensive rehearsals. Apart from the school performances and Singapore (SYF) competition, our Band also contributes to the community by putting up annual National Day performances for the residents of Mountbatten and Dakota.
