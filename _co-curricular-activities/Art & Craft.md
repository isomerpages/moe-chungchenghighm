Art & Crafts aims to develop in our students the ability to communicate thoughts, ideas and feelings through visual arts, and motivate talented students to achieve excellence in artistic expression.

Through a wide range of art related programme, the CCA provides an effective platform that promotes and supports healthy lifestyle, and a strong appreciation for the aesthetics.
