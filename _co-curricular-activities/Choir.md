Choir aims to nurture the artistic development of our students by allowing them to explore and hone their vocal and musical talents, fostering personal growth and self-expression. Within this supportive environment, we promote teamwork and collaboration, helping students enhance their interpersonal skills and form enduring friendships. Through our commitment to performance excellence, we provide platforms for our students to showcase their talent through competitions, concerts and choral exchange programmes, building their confidence and stage presence. Furthermore, our program enriches students' musical education by teaching music theory, sight-reading, and vocal techniques, offering a well-rounded approach to our Choir CCA.
