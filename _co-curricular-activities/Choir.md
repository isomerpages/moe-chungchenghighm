Our Choir CCA aims to inspire our students to appreciate singing in a choral group and learn how to evaluate their mastery progress. Our teachers emphasise on building teamwork and teaching discipline in the Choir training, while our instructors strive to equip our students with skills to perform a wide repertoire of music with different styles and cultures.
