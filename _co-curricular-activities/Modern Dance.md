Our Modern Dance CCA has always been brimming with confidence in every performance when the audience is impressed by the dancers’ immense passion and hard work put in. Our CCA teachers seek to maximise the potential in every dancer through various performances such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). Be it in their dance skills, choreography work, or VIA contribution to help others, our Chung Cheng dancers are always ready to give their best.
