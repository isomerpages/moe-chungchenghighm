Our St John Brigade CCA aspires to fulfill the Motto of the Order of St John – “Pro Fide, Pro Utilitate Hominum” (For the Faith and the Service of Humanity) through various learning activities. We aim to inspire our students to serve the community and equip them with life-saving and nursing skills that can make the difference between life and death in situations of emergency. There are many opportunities for our students to develop their social skills and leadership capabilities when they serve first-aid public duties and conduct workshops to educate others.
