Our English Drama CCA aims to nurture and develop our students into confident and creative youths, who can tell stories that move and make an impact on others in positive ways, on a variety of stages and platforms. Our students are young leaders in their field waiting to explore the world, leading themselves to become role-models for others, and leading others to lead a purposeful, meaningful and beautiful life.
