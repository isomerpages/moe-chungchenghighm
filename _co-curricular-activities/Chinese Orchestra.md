Our Chinese Orchestra CCA carries the mission of promoting biculturalism and appreciation of Chinese culture and music in the school. With a repertoire of performances showcased in either school-based and public concerts or events, our students are not only trained to become adept performers, but to undertake the role of learned ambassadors for Chinese culture.
