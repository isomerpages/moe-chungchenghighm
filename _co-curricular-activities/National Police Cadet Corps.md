Our National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) CCA seeks to groom respectful cadets and righteous citizens with a strong sense of justice and loyalty to the school and the corps. Our cadets also learn about the importance of upholding law and order in society. Through the close partnership with the Singapore Police Force, our NPCC students learn essential skills and knowledge to build up positive character traits such as self-reliance and public-spiritedness, so that they can grow to be confident leaders.
