Our Chinese Calligraphy and Brush Painting provides students with cultural knowledge and technical skills to independently complete a wholesome and presentable Calligraphy and/or Chinese Painting work. Though visits to various local exhibitions, students are introduced to advanced skills of Calligraphy and Chinese Painting. The beauty of the traditional art is reinforced and inspires students to cultivate a strong culture of sharing and promoting Calligraphy and Chinese Painting to people from all walks of life.
