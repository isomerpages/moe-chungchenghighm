Our Badminton Team seeks to develop disciplined sportsmen with strong determination and resilience. In every training session, our players were challenged to enhance their psychomotor skills, fitness and agility. With strong camaraderie and focus, we are a committed team that is not afraid of challenges and is motivated to better ourselves and work towards sporting excellence.
