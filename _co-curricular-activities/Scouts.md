Our Scouts CCA provides opportunities for students to venture out in the great outdoors as they work with members as a team. They are closely guided by teachers and experienced volunteer Scouters. There are ample opportunities for students to make friends with Scouts from other schools, and from all over the world. They learn beyond basic skills and teamwork. Our scouting activities encourage them to achieve a deeper appreciation for service to others in our community. From 2020 onwards, our Scouts activities will be held mainly on weekdays instead of Saturdays.
