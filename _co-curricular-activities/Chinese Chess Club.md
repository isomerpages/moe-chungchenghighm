Our Chinese Chess Club CCA provides many opportunities for student-enthusiasts to challenge one another in strategy analysis and problem-solving in the chess game. By holding the annual Chinese Chess “Xiangqi” tournament, our CCA takes on the mission of sharing with others the unique heritage of the Chinese chess game.
