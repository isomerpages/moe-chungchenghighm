Our Netball CCA aims to cultivate in our girls a sense of appreciation and passion for sports. In our many activities, we emphasise on character-building, while honing game skills to strive for better team performances. Our CCA also provides challenges beyond the National School Games to help our players to be more resilient and confident.
