Our Lion & Dragon Dance is an integral part of Chung Cheng High’s cultural heritage, with a strong troupe of students striving their best to put up the best performances with the lions. Our teachers and students value teamwork and discipline as they train hard for performances and competitions. With every lion dance performance, our students play cultural ambassadors in carrying on this traditional Chinese performing art.
