Our Table Tennis CCA emphasises on school values such as perseverance and passion in every training session and competition. Displaying a strong fighting spirit, our boys’ and girls’ teams have always maintained a high level of camaraderie and teamwork. Our teachers and coaches are also ready to support our students not only in improving their game techniques but also to build stronger resilience and perseverance.
