The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive. It seeks to equip students with the digital skills to be future-ready. 

Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD). Students may use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

The use of the PLD for teaching and learning aims to:

*	support the development of digital literacy,
*	support self-directed and collaborative learning, and
*	enhance teaching and learning.

To complement the PLD initiative, MOE will centrally provide students with digital tools, such as Google Workspace, Zoom and Microsoft Pro Plus.
