The ALP is intended to help students appreciate the relevance and value of academic subjects (e.g. Social Science, Mathematics) to the real world in order to develop stronger motivation and purpose for acquiring knowledge and skills. The emphasis is on the application of thinking skills, integrating knowledge across subject disciplines, stretching the imagination and applying these in real-world settings in society and industries. Some focus areas can include Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), Languages, Social Sciences, Business & Entrepreneurship and Life Skills.

Encouraged by the positive responses from the July 2018 Taster Modules, the school will roll out 6 learning modules under the ALP in Semester 1 of 2019. Synopses and outlines of these modules can be found under the “2019 Modules” tab. Students who opted for the ALP can use these information to select their desired modules in January 2019.
