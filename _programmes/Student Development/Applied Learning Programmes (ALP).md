The Applied Learning Programme at Chung Cheng High (Main) aims to help students appreciate the relevance and value of academic subjects to the real world. 

Started in 2019, the school offers a wide variety of Applied Learning Modules across different subject disciplines. The programme is structured to provide opportunities for our Upper Secondary students to take ownership of their learning.

Sec 3 and 4 students are allowed to choose up to two learning modules every semester. Each module will provide opportunities for students to develop enduring and transferable skills they will need as they work in the 21st century.
