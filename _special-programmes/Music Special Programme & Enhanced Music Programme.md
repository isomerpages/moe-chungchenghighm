The Music Special Programme (MuSP) seeks to develop Sec One &amp; Two students’ passion in music. Students are immersed in an enriched musical environment comprising weekly music lessons, music-making activities and opportunities to perform when they participate in music CCAs. Most MuSP students will continue their study of the subject at the O-Level by joining the Enhanced Music Programme. More information for both programmes is found in the&nbsp;enclosed&nbsp;[brochure](/files/CCHM-EMP-brochure-2022.pdf).

MuSP students and non-MuSP students with passion in music are encouraged to join the Enhanced Music Programme in Sec Three.
