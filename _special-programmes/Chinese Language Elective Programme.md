The Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) was introduced in 2020 by MOE. It aims to nurture effectively bilingual students with good understanding of Chinese Literature. In Chung Cheng High School (Main), CLEP is offered to all Secondary 3 and 4 students taking Chinese Literature or Chinese Literature (Elective).

We believe that the learning of Chinese language and literature takes place in multiple forms and settings hence we conduct a myriad of school-based activities and programmes, in addition to the MOE organised CLEP activities such as Sec 3 camp and overseas immersion programme. These include microcinema production enrichment workshop, literary lectures, competition trainings, drama appreciation learning journey and Cultural escape games.

Chung Cheng High School (Main) has also established our very own CLEP Family （悦习社）which aims to promote our Chung Cheng spirit and Chinese Culture to everyone. The CLEP Family consists of enthusiasts of Chinese Literature from Sec 3 and Sec 4 CLEP Students. The family comprises of 3 teams: The Creative Writing Team which strives to spark the interest for Chinese Literature in readers through their creative writing, The Literature Promoting Team that will serve to promote different forms of Chinese Literature to all our readers and The Publicity Team which aims to spread the love for Chinese Literature through the hosting of different activities.
