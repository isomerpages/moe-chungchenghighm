The Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) was introduced in 2020 by MOE. It aims to nurture effectively bilingual students with good understanding of Chinese Literature. In Chung Cheng High School (Main), CLEP is offered to all Secondary 3 and 4 students taking Chinese Literature or Chinese Literature (Elective).

We believe that the learning of Chinese language and literature takes place in multiple forms and settings hence we conduct a myriad of school-based activities and programmes, in addition to the MOE organised CLEP activities such as Sec 3 camp and overseas immersion programme. These include microcinema production enrichment workshop, literary lectures, competition trainings, drama appreciation learning journey and Cultural escape games.
