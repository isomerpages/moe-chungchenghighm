Our Bicultural Education Programme seeks to provide opportunities for students to be immersed in activities that will enhance their global awareness and cross-cultural competencies, such as understanding the national and cultural identity, developing socio-cultural sensitivity and awareness, which are essential competencies required in the 21st century.

It is structured into four main categories:

1. **Formal Curriculum** \[Appreciation of Chinese Culture & Chinese Painting and Calligraphy Lessons (Sec 1 & 2 students)\], Tea Art Lessons (Sec 1 to 4 students)\]

2. **Overseas Immersion Learning Programmes to China** (Selected Sec 2 & 3 students)

3. **Local Cultural Learning Journeys** (Malay Heritage Centre, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, Indian Heritage Centre)

4. **Docent Training Programmes** (River Hongbao Exhibition, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, School Heritage Centre)

5. **Chinese Language Elective Programme** (Sec 3 students who offer Literature in Chinese from 2020 onwards)

The Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese, and enhance their understanding of Chinese Literature. The programme also aims to develop these students to become effectively bilingual and bicultural.
